# List Filtering
One of my first ever coding projects that revolves around processing a list and filtering out words to create a new List_Filtered.
The function receives a list and a dictionary as inputs.
List_Filtered contains only the words which appear in the previous list a number of times equal to or greater than the dictionary's first value and equal to or less than the dictionary's second value.
